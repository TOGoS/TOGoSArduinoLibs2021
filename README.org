#+TITLE: TOGoS's Arduino Apps

Actually ESP8266 apps, mostly for WeMos D1 mini,
but I use the Arduino framework and IDE.

These rely on TOGoSArduinoLibs2021, which will hopefully
help me share code better than the other scattered Arduino projects.
I thought of making this just an 'apps' branch in that
same repo (which would also include the libs),
but I can always merge them later.

*** "Old" arduino projects

For reference.
Or maybe to update them to the new conventions and import them.

"Old" meaning "before TOGoSArduinoLibs20201"

- ArduinoPowerSwitch
- ESP8266-MQTT-Sensor
- Thermostat2019
- PowerCube
- ArduinoLightController
- ArduinoLEDAnimator2021
- ArduinoChargeController
