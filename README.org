#+TITLE: TOGoS's Arduino Libraries

My personal, homebrew Arduino libraries,
grouped into one repository for convenience.

To make available to the Arduino IDE,
symlink each subdirectory (~TOGoSStringView~, etc)
into your Arduino libraries directory.
On windows this is commonly ~C:/Users/Your.Name/Documents/Arduino/libraries/~.
